# Gogo

## Download

Install the CLI from the published release:

```bash
go install github.com/cybersaksham/gogo/cmd/gogo@v0.1.1
```

Use the framework as a Go module:

```bash
go get github.com/cybersaksham/gogo@v0.1.1
```

Prebuilt CLI binaries and checksums are available from GitHub Releases:

https://github.com/cybersaksham/gogo/releases

If a newly published tag is not available from the public Go checksum database
yet, install directly from Git:

```bash
GOPROXY=direct GONOSUMDB=github.com/cybersaksham/gogo \
  go install github.com/cybersaksham/gogo/cmd/gogo@v0.1.1
```

Requirements:

- Go `1.26.4` or newer.
- Git.

Clone the repository:

Keep `.env` out of Git. Commit `.env.example` only.
